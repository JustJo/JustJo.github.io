    <a name="the-challenge"></a><h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>By the end of 2017, SafetyCulture’s flagship product <a href="https://safetyculture.com/iauditor/" target="_blank">iAuditor</a> was in the hands of users all around the world.</p>
    <p>When iAuditor came to market in 2012, its customer base mostly consisted of small accounts. As the product matured, it attracted larger organisations. Unfortunately, the user management tools remained largely untouched, resulting in customers struggling to perform basic user management tasks.</p>
    <p>I undertook the task of improving the administrative experience of user management within iAuditor.</p>
    {{> spacer size='50'}}
    <a name="defining-the-problem"></a><h2>Defining the Problem</h2>
    <p>To understand the problem space we collected internal feedback from support staff who help iAuditor administrators daily. We also conducted extensive customer interviews. Through this research phase we identified administrative goals, jobs to be done and pain points which led to the following problem statement:</p>
    <p><strong>It’s time consuming, and sometimes impossible for administrators to find information they need about their iAuditor users.</strong></p>
    <h3>Scattered User Information</h3>
    <p>Administrators, for a variety of reasons ranging from user set up, to troublehooting, often seek the following user information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>General details (name, email address, device allocation)</li>
      <li>Permission settings</li>
      <li>Group membership</li>
      <li>Template access</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unfortunately there was no one place in iAuditor where this information was accessible. Detailed below are the four sections of iAuditor that administrators navigated through to find such information.</p>

    <h3>Hang on, that means...</h3>
    <p>In an account that had 4 groups and 4 templates, the administrator would need to visit 12 pages to gather the user information they commonly require for just one user. Given that most accounts have considerably more templates and groups, it is clear to see why this process is so frustrating.</p>

    <h3>Unmet needs</h3>
    <p>While the core issue revolved around visibility, there were other, more managerial, tasks that administrators commonly needed to do, but couldn’t. These included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Editing a user’s account details (name, email address, time zone and notification settings)</li>
      <li>Resetting a user’s password</li>
      <li>Viewing what devices a user had registered</li>
      <li>Removing devices on behalf of the user</li>
    </ul>
    {{> spacer size='50' }}
    <a name="improving-administrators-visibility"></a><h2>Improving Administrators Visibility</h2>
    <p>Equipped with a clear understanding of the problem, our attention turned to how we might provide administrators with easy access and management of user information in one location. After thorough consideration, it was determined that we could provide this access by introducing User Profiles to iAuditor. A User profile would give administrators a central place where they could:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>View and edit basic user details/settings</li>
      <li>View and remove user devices</li>
      <li>View a list of all the templates a user had access to</li>
      <li>View a list of all the groups a user was a member of</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Early Mockups</h3>
    <p>We produced mockups that helped internal stakeholders visualise our solution and ultimately get buy-in to proceed with the project. We also utilised these mockups to validate our solution during user testing sessions. For our user testing sessions we created a basic prototype with these mocks using Invision.</p>

    <h3>Efficiency vs Confidence</h3>
    <p>In our proposed User Profile, administrators could do two core things, view and edit data. Alot of thought went into how we would handle these two states. Commonly there are two patterns for editing data.</p>
    <p><strong>Single-field inline editing:</strong> With this approach the edit mode is integrated into the view mode, allowing for quick single field editing. This solution requires additional UI on each field to show that it is editable. The downside of this method is that unintentional edits are easy to make. This style favours efficiency over confidence.</p>

  {{> columns large='8' large_offset='2' medium='12' medium_offset='0' small='12' }}
    {{> spacer size='50' }}
    <p><strong>Multi-field inline editing:</strong> With this approach a user switches between the view and edit state. Because the two states are separate, unintentional edits are less likely to occur, but the user has to click more. This style favours confidence over efficiency.</p>

    <p>For administrative tasks we concluded that we should favour confidence over efficiency, which resulted in us going with the multi-field approach.</p>
    <h3>Scalability</h3>
    <p>iAuditor, like many SASS products, evolved constantly. In a year’s time, the needs of administrators would likely expand. With this in mind, a core focus throughout the design process was scalability.</p>

    <a name="the-result"></a><h2>The Result</h2>
    <p>In 2018 User Profiles were released in iAuditor, accessible from the User List page. At the time of writing this article most of the features described below are implemented. A User Profile contains 4 tabs: user settings, devices, templates and groups. Adding to and restructuring these tabs is possible as the product grows, ensuring scalability.</p>

    <a name="conclusion"></a><h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>We intended to measure the impact of this project by monitoring the number of support tickets that came through regarding specific administrative tasks and comparing them to our historical data. Unfortunately, there was an internal change to how support requests were categorised soon after the launch of User Profiles. This meant that we didn't end up with quantitive data to verify if this project was a success. However we had enough qualitative feedback from customers and internally to indicate that administrators now have the visibility and ability they require to more effectively manage their iAuditor users</p>
